                <h1>The Beginning of Asturias and Oviedo </h1>

                <p>
                    During the year 720, the whole Iberian peninsula was occupied by the Moors, 
                    except for a small region on the north, which would later create the Kingdom of Asturias.
                    <br>
                    The original name of Oviedo (capital of the Kingdom) was <i>"Ovetum"</i> and the first records of it date back to the middle ages, 
                    around the 8th century, probably founded in the year 762. This capital would later be moved to other cities like Leon and later Toledo.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This north region contained the poorest cities of the peninsula, so it was not deemed as a threat by the Moors.
                    <br>
                    In 722, with the battle of Covadonga (beautiful place also in Asturias), the <b>Reconquista</b> started. 
                    This was a series of conflicts between the Christians and Muslims, 
                    ending in Granada (the south of Spain) in 1492, with the Christians reclaiming the peninsula.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Reconquista was one of the most important periods in our country's history, and the presence of the Muslim culture left us amazing architecture and traditions.

                <img src="img/history/CaminoDeSantiago.png" alt="Map of the Camino de Santiago" style="float: left;">
                <br>
                <p>
                    The so called <b>"Camino Primitivo"</b> (or "Original Way") is the oldest path of the "Camino de Santiago".
                    <br>
                    This "original way" is over 300km long, starting from the <b>El Salvador</b> cathedral in Oviedo, which was once a very importante pilgrimage destination.
                    It was first used by Asturians in the 9th century, inagurated by King Alfonso III. Since then, there are 5 different official routes to follow, as well as many unofficials.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Camino is visited by over 400.000 turists every year, and it takes you along beautiful countryside, old roman cities like Lugo, and gastronomy-rich regions. 
                    <br> <br>
                    For many, it is a very rewarding experience, even if you don't do it for religious reasons, most people have a positive outcome. It is said to help you copnnect with yourself or others who keep you company during the Way.
                    <br>
                    The Way crosses two autonomous communities, Asturias and then Galicia. The second being known as the part of Spain with the most mitology and lengends, with different mystic character following you along the way. 
                    We won't get too much into detail, just know that if you are lost in the mountains of northern spain at night and hear some bells, don't look back!

                <img src="img/history/franco.png" alt="Dictator Francisco Franco" style="float: right;">
                <br>
                <p>
                    During the years 1939 to 1975, Spain was under the dictatorship of <b>Francisco Franco</b> (whose wife was from Oviedo), 
                    following the end of a Civil war between republicans and franquists. 
                    <br> <br>
                    Oviedo witnessed importante battles during the Civil War, the most important being the <b>Battle of Oviedo</b>(1936),
                    it lasted months and destroyed most of the city, which was later re-build under the dictator mandate. <br> 
                    <br>
                    Like in the rest of Spain, people not affiliated to the Regimen were persecuted, which led to many incarcerations and executions,
                    as well as countless exiles. 
                    <br>
                    The dictatorship caused a economic decline in fields like mines, very important in Asturias, and gave more importance to the 
                    traditional agrarian lifestyle.
                    <br> <br>
                    Following Francos death in 1975, Oviedo and the rest of the country, experienced a slow transition to a democracy and 
                    parliamentary monarchy.
