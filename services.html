                        The waste collection system in Oviedo is highly structured and eco-friendly. 
                        Residents and businesses are provided with designated containers for sorting recyclable materials such as 
                        paper, plastic, glass, and organic waste. These containers are strategically located across neighborhoods, 
                        ensuring easy access for everyone. Additionally, bulky waste like furniture and appliances can be picked up 
                        by request through the city's special collection service. Oviedo also operates recycling centers where residents 
                        can responsibly dispose of hazardous materials.

                        The streets of Oviedo are regularly cleaned using advanced equipment and

                        often take place during the early morning hours to minimize disruption to daily activities. In addition to
