                    <h2>Waste Collection</h2>
                    <img src="img/services/emulsaWaste.png" alt="City cleaning service in Oviedo" style="float: left;">
                    <p>
                        The waste collection system in Oviedo is highly structured and eco-friendly. 
                        Residents and businesses are provided with designated containers for sorting recyclable materials such as 
                        paper, plastic, glass, and organic waste. These containers are strategically located across neighborhoods, 
                        ensuring easy access for everyone. Additionally, bulky waste like furniture and appliances can be picked up 
                        by request through the city's special collection service. Oviedo also operates recycling centers where residents 
                        can responsibly dispose of hazardous materials.

                        The streets of Oviedo are regularly cleaned using advanced equipment and 
                        environmentally friendly practices. Water trucks equipped with high-pressure hoses are deployed to wash sidewalks 
                        and remove dirt and grime, particularly in high-traffic areas such as the city center and markets. These operations 
                        often take place during the early morning hours to minimize disruption to daily activities. In addition to

                        parks, ensuring that green spaces remain pristine for everyone to enjoy. Educational campaigns are conducted

                        By investing in modern technologies and sustainable practices, Oviedo has set a high standard for urban 
                        cleanliness, making it one of the cleanest and most environmentally conscious cities in Spain.
