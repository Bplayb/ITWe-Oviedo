                <p>
                    The most traditional and well-known musical instrument in Asturias is the Asturian bagpipe (<i>Gaita asturiana</i>). It is
                     a wind instrument with three pipes, constructed in a wide array of keys and types, anywhere from A to as high as E flat. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The traditional bagpiper, <i>gaitero asturiano</i>, will play the instrument wearing the Asturias' traditional suits, and it is 
                    often played in bands, along with drums, accordions and at least one bass drum.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Here in Oviedo, we have the biggest bagpipe band of the whole region, called the <i>Real Banda de Gaitas Ciudad de Oviedo</i>.
                </p>


                <h2>Oviedo's Royal Bagpipes Band</h2>
                
                <img src="img/RBGCDO/directors.png" alt="Most recent directors of the band">
                <p>
                    The Royal Band of Bagpipes "City of Oviedo" was founded back in 1992 by Adolfo García Blanco, who is still now the president. There has 
                    been several directors since, but the most recent active ones are Vicente Prado Suárez "El Praviano", José Manuel Fernández Gutiérrez "Guti",
                     and the recently deceased at an early age Yolanda Pérez Alonso "Yoly", who was much loved by all the members and will always be remembered. 
                    There band is currently formed by more than 60 musicians, most of them bagpipers. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As the official municipal band, the mainly offer shows in Oviedo and performances outside of this city have been relegated
                     to the background, although it's a tradition to play every year on some well known events such as the <i>International Sella River Descent</i>,
                     or travel all around the world to play in countries like China, Portugal, or two years ago in the Dominican Republic. We must not forget that,
                      in addition to the dissemination of traditional Asturian music, one of its main objectives is to actively participate in the life and events of
                       the city and the Council of Oviedo.
                </p>
                <img src="img/RBGCDO/CDO.png" alt="Photo of the band playing in the Cathedral's square" style="float: left;">
                <p>
                    There are many requests for the presence of the Band. Of all of them, approximately 130 performances are carried out per year (and increasing), 
                    with the main destinations being the towns and neighbourhoods of the Council. It is also worth highlighting its participation in the most 
                    important events in Oviedo: it has had great success in the Three Kings Parade (<i>Cabalgata de Sus Majestades los Reyes Magos</i>), 
                    the America Day in Asturias' parade, and its performance at the Princess of Asturias Awards Ceremony, which left almost half the world breathless. 
                    This last one is the most important event every year, when all the Spanish people over the country can hear them playing both the Spanish and 
                    Asturian anthems in front of the kings and the princess, among the traditional song <i>"Pasucáis de El Xarreru</i> while they exit the theater.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The large number of performances accumulated by the group led to  the birth of the  "Vetusta" Bagpipe Band in 1999, with the peculiarity that 
                    all its members are under eighteen years of age, and which is a sub-group of the band that has some performances of their own, but 
                    can play too with the whole band.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Regarding the musical repertoire, they play mainly asturian traditional songs, as well as some songs composed by the directors of the 
                    band (<i>Pasucáis Pixueto by Guti</i>), and some mixes of both traditional or not-so traditional songs (<i>Beatles mix</i>, with some of 
                    their most popular songs adapted to the bagpipe). But when Christmas comes, people will always be able to enjoy some good carols to the 
                    sound of the bagpipe.

                <h1>Food: not only <i>fabada</i> and <i>cachopo</i></h1>
                <p>
                    In Oviedo, as the capital of Asturias, we follow the traditions of the most tipycaldishes of the region, the best known being fabada 
                    (Asturian bean stew) and cachopo (two big veal fillets with some content, normally ham and some kind of cheese, all breaded). Nevertheless, we 
                    have ourselves some special meals and desserts.

                    <h2><i>"El Desarme"</i>'s menu</h2>
                    <img src="img/gastronomy/menu-desarme.png" alt="Photo of the Desarme's menu" style="float: left;">
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This is a commemoration that began at the end of the 19th century and continues to this day. Every October 19th, the capital 
                        commemorates the triumph of the Isabelline troops over the Carlists. The succulent and hearty Desarme menu is, as the legend 
                        says happened to the enemy soldiers, made to leave diners without strength. Chickpeas with cod and spinach, tripe and rice pudding 
                        as a typical dessert to top it off are the dishes that make up the menu and that you will find in many restaurants in the city. 
                        There is even a association that is responsible for ensuring that this custom that combines history and gastronomy is maintained.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Asturian cider: something to wash down the meal</h2>
                    <img src="img/gastronomy/gascona.png" alt="Photo of the Gascona's boulevard">
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In Asturias, the most common alcoholic beberage is not the beer, nor wine. It is the Asturian apple cider (<i>Sidra asturiana</i>) 
                        what almost everybody enjoys. With a low alcoholic content, and it's fresh apple flavor, it's perfect for every ocasion, and in Oviedo 
                        you can find it almost everywhere. The best place for having a bottle, is the Gascona boulevar, a street full of a special kind of bar 
                        called <i>"sidrería"</i> with an always lively atmosphere, and sometimes traditional music.

                    <h2>The sweetest part of Oviedo: our desserts</h2>
                    <img src="img/gastronomy/carbayones.png" alt="Photo of some carbayones desserts">
                    <p>
                        And to finish the "menu" with something sweet, we must talk about our most typical desserts, starting with the jewel of 
                        the crown: the <i>"carbayones"</i>. This dessert take its name from the people of Oviedo, since "carbayones" is what 
                        people of Oviedo are colloquially called, for a certain oak tree (<i>carbayo</i>) that was located in the main street. 
                        The sweet was created in the first third of the  20th century . Between 1920 and 1923, José de Blas, owner of the Camilo 
                        de Blas confectionery, commissioned his master baker, José Gutiérrez, to make a sweet that would represent the city of Oviedo. 
                        This sweet, the carbayón, would be unveiled at the first International Trade Fair of Asturias that took place in Gijón in 1924.

                    <img src="img/gastronomy/milhojas-confi.png" alt="Mille-feuille tart from Confitería Asturias" style="float: left;">
                    <p>The other well known dessert in Oviedo are the moscovitas: delicious cookies made from Marcona almonds and milk chocolate. They are 
                        crafted using traditional methods, featuring almond paste covered in chocolate.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        These, among tons of other traditional desserts, can be found in a large number of bakeries and pastry shops around the city. 
                        Maybe the most important ones are "Rialto", famous for their moscovitas, and "Confitería Asturias", with its famous "Letizia" 
                        cakes and its well-known mille-feuille tarts.
